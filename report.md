# GSoC'25 ExpectedReturns: Factor Formation Tests

## Prerequisites
- https://github.com/corsairier/ChatR-Tests-GSoC
- https://github.com/corsairier/ecotourism-GSoC_Test

These both are the tests of other GSoC projects coming under R language.

## Easy:

The installation of both the packages went smoothly. Just had to use 
`force=TRUE` option for the installation of FactorAnalysis package.

## Intermediate:

1. In `Commodities-long-run.Rmd`, there are many bugs related to bib and also many words flow out of the page.
2. In `expected-returns-replications.Rmd`, there are many warnings thrown related to bibtex and again many words flow out of the page.
3. In `Improving-time-series-momentum.Rmd`, there is some error related to the missing directory `sandbox/data/FuturesData/data/`.
4. In `Time-series-momentum.Rmd`, ff.dates error is encountered.
5. Some text flow out of the margins and the page.
6. In `Value-momentum-everywhere.Rmd`, we experience `object 'RF' not found`.
7. In `Which-factors.Rmd`, we experience this error,

`Error in attributes(xx) <- c(attributes(xx), dot.attrs):
! length of 'dimnames' [2] not equal to array extent`
